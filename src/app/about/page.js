                To date, programming is one of the most promising areas. Information technology has affected all spheres of our life
                and this process will not stop. This makes programming one of the most in-demand jobs in the world. Learning to code is not just a professional skill, but a gateway to various opportunities. A programmer is a person who will never be unemployed,
                who can work remotely, and do any kind of online business. But before reaching that status, you will have to make a lot of effort at the training stage.
